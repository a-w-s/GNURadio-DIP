Introduction
============

GNURadio-DIP contains the setup files for installing Image Processing Blocks in GNURadio.  To equip GNURadio with Image Processing capability OpenCV is used. The Image Processing module includes 5 blocks which can be used for performing many Image Processing functionality. Module includes the following blocks for grayscale images: 

	1. Image Source block
	2. Image Sink block
	3. Invert Image block.
	4. Sub-Image block
